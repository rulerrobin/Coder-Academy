## Q1

A markup language is defined by a system based on a set of elements such as keywords, names and tags to present a given page and the content within it. They are the building blocks of web pages. Essentially, a markup language is used by a computer to display that is readable for people therefore it is commonly written in the common language rather than programming language terminology. The main language used of the internet is HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) all pages are written in HTML or a version of it. 

There is a difference between markup languages and programming languages, what makes markup different is that the language itself is not based on algorithms and dynamic programming based on a database, it is a static language that can only be edited through making changes to the HTML tags.

All markup languages share the fact that a "tag" is used to present and differentiate content on a page, these tags are usually wrapped in angled brackets `<>`. This is because when developing the web page the text and instructions need to be separated for the computer to understand what is required. Each tag defines a specific section of the page an example of this is below where a link to google would be displayed in "Go to Google" within the body of the page.

```html
<body>
    <a href="https://google.com">Go to Google</a>
</body>
```

Furthermore HTML has a special way of defining tags built into the language which assists with screen readers for those who have need of accessibility features, these are called semantic tags. Semantic tags are used to replace `<div>` and provide more specific and meaningful information to both browsers and developers. In HTML there are several semantic tags that can be taken advantage of an example of this are the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags which can be used to create a clear representation that the element displayed is an image with context information not being lost in a general `<div>` as it is within the `<figcaption>` tag. Another example of this is the `<form>` which is used to represent forms. Overall semantic tags are a significant component of HTML as it provivdes clearer context to developers and the web page itself whilst also providing better accessibility to those who need it.

The HTML markup language in has a specific way of setting up the web page within the IDE so that it is functional. The first is `<!DOCTYPE html>` which gives the web page information on what type of page to expect in this case it would be HTML5. The next would be the `<head>` which is a container for things such as metadata (charsets, doc title, styles, viewports, keywards, etc). The data itself is not displayed however has a significant impact on the page itself. The final part of the markup language that is needed is the `<body>` this component houses all of the content on the page and can be manipulated through the use of styling which can be done within the tags used in `<body>` or in `<head>`.

Another common and significant component of the markup languages for HTML is the ability to style the content, the ability to create a web page itself is simple enough but styling is what gives it the sense of identity that makes up the internet. The . This can be done within the HTML document itself through either inline styling or internal sheet styling, otherwise best practice is to use a separate CSS or Cascading Style Sheet file that is linked to the HTML document. Inline styling is where the styling itself is done within the element itself so for example below;

```html
<h4 style="color:white; font-size:23px"> Example Text </h4>
```
Internal sheet styling is where the `<style>` tag contains the styling information usually located within the `<head>`. This is usually completed using the selectors; Type, Class, ID, Pseudo Classes. The syntax for this is the same as for having an external stylesheet.
```css
h1 {
    color: #ad3103;
    text-align: center;
}
```
An external stylesheet is the recommended way to style content for a few reasons, including; reusability between pages by linking the one page, separation of concerns meaning content and functionality are separated making code easier to read and maintain, caching as the browser will not have to download the CSS document every time which increases the performance and compatibility as different browsers support different styles.

Synax for linking a stylesheet;

`<link rel="stylesheet" href = "css/style.css">`

## Q2
### Packets
Packets are a unit of data that is a segment of data that are grouped together and transferred usually over the internet.There are a few components of a packet these are header, the payload and the trailer. The header contains the information needed to transfer the packet between start and end destination, this includes the IP addresses of both sender and reciever, the packet number, the length of the packet and the protocols used e.g. emmail, web page, streaming. The payload simply put is the actual data being sent. A key detail of payloads is that if the payload is not the correct size and the packet is a fixed length, the payload will then be padded with blank data to match the packet size. The trailer also known as a footer is basically the data at the end of the packet that signals to the receiver that it is the end of the packet. n some cases it may also contain some error checking within the couple of bits of data it contains.

To transfer packets over the internet, packets are cut into small pieces of data that are sent over and received from multiple sources in any order using a system called packet switching. In essence it is a system that sends the packets through several highways depending on the best path for the specific packet and if there are issues with any path they are rerouted and a signal is sent to the other packets as well. Packets are an integral part of the development of the internet as without the packet system and pack switching system the internet itself would be a lot less efficient. With packets and the sytem used it allows data to be sent and received from multiple sources all at once, transferring billions of devices data all at the same time. Creating an entire network of connections and data to servers, users, developers all at once. Without packets to transmit between devices and in the way that they do they would not be able to communicate with each other and the internet as we know today would not exist. They are absolutely essential to the operation and transmission of data over networks.


### IP Addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)

An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to devices that are connected to a network, this IP allows them to send and receive data from other devices connected to the network, this is also used when sending and receiving data over the internet which can be thought of as one big interconnected network of networks. The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses is that IPv4 addresses are the most common however this is likely due to the fact that IPv6 addresses are the latest version of IP standard. IPv4 addresses are denoted by a dotted-decimar notation e.g. 192.168.1.1 and uses 32 bit address space having a total of about 4.3 billion possible addresses. IPv6 addresses are denoted using hexadecimal notation e.g 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, it also uses a larger bit system of 128 bit meaning it is significantly larger in terms of possible IP's.

IP addresses also have location data however in a lot of cases it is not exactly reliable. IP addresses are one of the most essential features of the internet because without IP addresses to differentiate each device it would be impossible for them communicate and connect. They provide an easy way to identity and communicate over the internet for a device, as each and every device has a unique IP address that can be used to connect to other devices. Without IP addresses the packet system would not be able to work and with the development of IPv6 it ensures that there is a enormouse amount of IP addresses available for new and emerging devices connecting to the internet.

### Routers and Routing

Routers are a type of device that allows you to connect several devices or networks together and allows communication between them. Routers themselves have their own IP address to allow this. A routing is the device responsible for sending the packets between networks and devices, they have the ability to read and route the packets between networks and devices.  Since establishing that a router is a networking device it is also possible to use it to create more networks within a larger network to imrpove performance and decrease the risk of network attacks and congestion due to the more manageable size of networks created. Routers also have the capability to create security protocols to protect the network and devices from attacks and unwanted connections.

The transfer and processing of data between devices and networks is called routing and this is usually done by routers. The routing process is performed by finding the best possible path based on things such as congestion, pathway availability, address and by doing this a routing table is created by the router and saved to be used for future routing operations as it saves the best path possible for the data to travel. 

Without routers and routing there would again be no way for the internet that we have today to exist because without a router networks would end up being congested, higher susceptibility to attacks and higher risk as all devices and networks would then be connected to one place. Routers are also the ones that examine the packets to determine where to send them and how which means that without routers to route the data it would end up going nowhere or just congest the highway of data. Without routers and routing there would be no way for the internet to communicate as efficiently and safely.

### Domains and DNS

A domain is the readable unique identifier of an online address on the internet e.g. www.google.com. They are designed for humans to be able to understand and also easily remmember/use. Domains are normally made of three parts in a heirarchal manner these are the top-level domain (TLD) this includes .org .net .edu for example. The next part are the second-level domains (SLD) and third level domains (TLD), in genuel.zapanta.com "zapanta" is the second level domain, "genuel" is the third level domain and "com" is the top level domain. 

A top level domain is managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and then given to registrars which are then send to comapnies or individuals to use. A second level domain is the easy to identity part of the domain and a third level domain (or sub domain) is something that can be created to refer to specific sections, pages or even a department of a company. 

The system known as DNS is short for Domain Name System, it is responsible for tramistting and translating domain names into the IP address that it represents. Essentially it removes the need to memorise an IP address. It is a system that is available to servers globally so that the internet is accessible. 

The Domain Name System is responsible to the functionality of the internet, it lets users easily identify domain names without needing to memorise IP addresses to access a website or other online resources and services. It can adapt to IP address changes and also provides the ability for individuals and organisations to use a system that does not need to remember any IP address assignment. By doing this as well domains are also used to brand different websites, products, companies, services and essentially differentiate the internet from each other. The Domain Name System has also allowed use for the Uniform Resource Locators OR URL's to become a large part of the internet. Allowing people to navigate the internet easily. Without Domanis and DNS the internet would not be able to easily develop and grow to be easily accessible to everyone, it would not be possible to connect to different sites without assistance from a directory of IP's and their descriptions, the development of the internet itself would not have been possible without the connections the the DNS and Domains created and allowed.

## Q3

### TCP

TCP or Transmission Control Protocol is a standard used to define or control how a network conversation is conducted and by which devices over a network. It is a protocol that is essentially a virtual circuit, it transmits data between devices and ensures that the data is correct transmitted without packets lost, however in the case that there is, the TCP can detect packets out of order and use this data to determine packets lost. In essence it is a traffic manager of the highway system of packets.

It has contributed greatly to the client and server communication over the intnernet because the TCP system provides a mechanism that ensures that data is transferred correctly without issue and if there is, that there is a way to fix it. This is because it ensures that the connection is established and then maintains this connection between the client and the server until data is finished being transmitted this also means until the data is fixed and synchronized between client and server in case packets go missing and need to be resent. The responsibility of managing how data should be broken and sent through is also a part of TCP, so essentially without TCP, there is no manager of transferring data between devices. By using TCP the client and server communication system has been made efficient and easily manageable over the internet.


### HTTP and HTTPS

HTTP or HyperText Transfer protocol is the foundation of all data on the internet; it is the application in which all data on the web happens. HTTPS or HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure is an enhanced version that provides more secure information transfers. It does this through an encryption known as the Transport Layer Security (TSL) it essentially creates a security system using two different keys between two parties, a Private key and a Public Key. The HTTP system provides users a way to interact with resources such as HTML files by transmitting the data between clients and servers. The client side data is known as a request and service side messages are called responses.

The technology of HTTP has greatly contributed to the development of client and server communication. It is the basis of all data transfers on the internet as it allows the web browser being used such as Chrome, Firefiox, Safari among others to communicate with the server so that the web is usable and accessible. It is a fundamental part of the internet and used in most if not all cases because it is very flexible in use. It is able to allow interaction with hypertext documents such as HTML but it can also be used for images, videos, posting to servers, retrieving documents or parts of websites as well. Without HTTP interaction with the internet would be much harder and less intuitive.

### Web Browsers (Requests, rendering and developer tools)

Web Browsers are a program that takes information from the web and is used to explore it as well, they do this by retrieving information and displaying it on a piece of hardware whether it be a monitor, phone, table, etc. Not all browsers are the same however as some users depending on the browser may see a website differently than others this is done through a web request and rendering. A web request is an instruction completed by the browser, there are several types of web requests that do several things, however they are all in relation to connecting the client to the server via communication. These web requests in general follow a pattern of a DNS lookup, browser sending a HTTP request, server sends a response with the hypertext file, web rendering, subsequent requests are send for responses for anything else that needs to be loaded such as CSS files, images etc). The rendering process takes place during these steps so that code on the files turn into the pages that users are able to interact with and this is usually done by a web rendering engine.

Developer tools are programs built into web browsers that allow developers to understand the backbone of code behind web content. The basic functionality though different to an extend are the same between browsers, they can inspect to open the code, open a debugger and open network and performance charts. They are used by developers to create, test and debug software as it allows users to make changes to the site without actually making a saved change.

Web browsers have had a significant impact on the development of client and server communication over the internet and there are many reasons for this. Web browsers allow users to make requests to servers to access resources which has led to the foundation of the internet through the development of API’s, applications, websites and more. Rendering has pushed the limits of the user experience when interacting with web pages to make things more intuitive for the user and has also allowed for the emergence of “responsive design” which adapts to the current climate of screen sizes. By being able to use developer tools developers have been allowed to test and create websites and applications with high performance, responsive design and user experience just from their web browser and testing things from there alone without needing an IDE to check absolutely everything they are able to do it with just a web browser.

## Q4

There are several data structures in Python and each of them have their uses with advantages and disadvantages for each, data structures in Python differe based on **Mutability** which is if an object can be changed and manipulated after creation and **Order** which in this case refers to if an element can be accessed using the position within the structure. Some of these data structures are similar to each other and have similar properties however their use cases are still different. An example of this are lists, sets and tuples.

A list is a dynamic mutable array that has a collection of accessible elements that are ordered. This type of structure is used to represent and store several items and because it is dynamic it means that it can be manipulated and changed with code such as `.append()` or `.remove()`. This type of structure is most useful when the data stored is a collection of different types that will or may need to be changed in the future or even operated on. They can even be used to represent structures within the list however because they are mutable they tend to have a slower run time that something such as an immutable tuple. A Tuple is very similar to a list however when using a tuple it is naturally an immutable structure which means that it will run faster than a list however can and only should be used to represent data that will not be changed in the future as the data within a natural tuple is immutable. A set is still in the same vein as a list and tuple however there is 2 significant differences when using a Python set. When using a Python set there can be no duplicates and the values are also unordered. The major advantage of this type of structure is that because there is no duplicates which means that it is highly efficient at finding a specific element within the data set however the data within the set is immutable however the order can be changed.
