## Exception Handling
* Responding to errors thrown in prgram
* Recovering from errors
* Errors can be thrown either by program or developer

Value Errors: Incorrect data value inputted

Try except block / try catch block will run w/e code in block and any erros will be sent to except block

```python
# Numerator and denominator from the user and calculate quotient
# Try except block / try catch block will run w/e code in block and any erros will be sent to except block
# try except else finally blocks

class NegativeError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    n = int(input("Enter a numerator: "))
    d = int(input("Enter denominator: "))

    q = n / d # Exception was thrown/raised on this line for ZerDivison Error

    # we want to raise an error when either n or d is negative
    if n < 0 or d < 0:
        raise Exception("Negative number error")

    print(q)

except NegativeError:
    print("No negative numbers please")

except ZeroDivisionError as e: # command after except is w/e error that will be accepted
    print ("Denominator cannot be zero")    
    print (e)
    print (type(e))

except ValueError as e: # Exception means w/e exception was raised and saved in variable e
    print ("Please type numbers only")    
    print (e)
    print (type(e))    

except Exception as e: # Exception means w/e exception was raised and saved in variable e
    print ("Something went wrong")    
    print (e)
    print (type(e))

else:
    # executed whenever try block is successfully executed without raising any exception
    print ("I am else block")

finally:
    # this runs at the end no matter if exception is raised or not
    print("i am finally block")

print ("The end of the program")

# file handling
# try:
    # open file
    # write something on it - this line may raise error
# except:
    # do something when expcetion is raised
#finally:
    # close file here instead of try so that it 100% closes instead of leaving open if expcetion is raised
```

## Testing
* Testing functionality
* Maker sure functionality don't break when you change code

When using pytest(package) it searches for files either starting or ending with test_ e.g. test_calculator.py. To run a file with pytest type `pytest` in terminal. It tests than outputs functions result in terminal if passed, also need to use `test_` for start of functions.

`assert` is needed to est functions as it lets you test if a condition in your code returns True

## File Handling

Files access is handled by the OS. 
1. Checks if file exists
2. Checks if permission to access is granted
3. Checks actual location on the drive (may also do a check to see if file is already in use)
4. Puts file in memory buffer such as RAM as easier to access (more efficient)
5. Creates data structure tht holds things such as, where is the buffer, which program has file opened (for reading, writing, etc).

`open()` is a function that Python provides to open files **DEFAULT READ ONLY** if no file exists a file will be created but need `('w')` 
* `('w')` is write
* `('r')` is read
* `('a')` is append
`close()` is a function that should always be the final thing to close the file 
**IMPORTANT** not to forget for memory.

A text file is just a string in python so doing something like below will result only in 3 characters. However if another print is done it takes the next characters. Essentially it is indexing the file and new lines count as a character.

```python
with open('shopping-list.txt') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(f'Item: {line.strip()}') # reads line by line
    # data = f.readline().strip()
    # data = f.read(3) # reads first three chars
    # spam = f.read(2) # reads next 2
    # print(data.strip())
    # print(spam)
```
If a file already exists and if opening with write mode the `f.write` text will override whatever is inside it.

Typically when adding to files they are in a list.

```python
shows = [
    'The Witcher'
    'The X Files'
    'Star Trek Picard'
]
# WRITING FILES
with open('tv-shows.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('\n'.join(shows)) # concatenates strings using the content in ''
```

### CSV 


```python
with open ('people.csv') as f:
    # reader = csv.reader(f) # Creates a reader object based on the file object and it is iterable
    reader = csv.DictReader(f) # Creates a dict instead of list to index for data as we ll as using top row for keywords
    # reader.__next__() # means go to next row e.g. without this it would include header row
    for row in reader:
        print(f"{row['name']} is {row['age']} years old and {row['height']} cm tall")
```


```python
with open('cafe-menu.csv', 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, menu[0].keys()) # insttead of a hard code list it accesses the [0] item and gets they .keys from there
    # writer = csv.DictWriter(f, ['item', 'price']) # accepts a list and writes it out as a CSV file | to ommit a column
    # writer.writerow(['item', 'price'])
    writer.writeheader() # because its a dict it will write keys as headers
    writer.writerows(menu)
```

### JSON

Formatted as though it looks like a dict, it is under the `JSON` data structures which is why it needs to be imported into python.
```json
[
    {
        "title": "The Shawshank Redemption", // key must be in double quotes
        "director": "Frank Darabont",
        "stars": ["Morgan Freeman","Tim Robbins","Clancy Brown","Bob Gunton"],
        "box_office": { "budget": 25000000, "us_gross": 28767189, "worldwide_gross": 28884504 }
    }
]
```

An import can look like this:
```python
with open ('movies.json') as f: # opens file as f
    # load reads the whole file at once whilst csv goes line b line
     movies = json.load(f) # parses json data into python objects of lists and dictionariees
     print(movies[0])
```

To write a new json file
```python
with open ('cafe-menu.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(menu, f, indent=2) # first parameter is data structure to file, second is where it goes since `f` is opened as **file** indent 
```
