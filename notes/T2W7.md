## **What is JavaScript**

* Dynamically-typed (like Ruby or Python)
* Interpreted or JIT-compiled
* The only language a web browser natively understands
* Syntax inspired by C / C++ / Java
* Client (web browser) or server-side (via NodeJS)
* Required knowledge of all web developers

**History**

* Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich (co-founder of Mozilla)
* Javascript has nothing to do with Java
  * Named this way for marketing reasons
* The first version was written in 10 days 
* Several fundamental language decisions were made because of company politcs and not technical reasons

`" I was under marketing orders to make it look like Java but not make it too big for it's britches... [it] needed to be a silly little langauge."`

## **Javascript in the browser**

**Code in Web Pages**

HTML can embed JavaScript files in to the web page via the `<script>` tag.

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>CS 193X</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
        <script src="filename.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    ... contents of the page...
    </body>
</html>
```

**How does JavaScript get loaded?**

1. The browser parses the HTML file and finds a `<script>` tag
2. Browser makes a request to server for the `script.js`file
3. Server responds with JavaScript file just like it would with CSS or image files
4. Now once it loads the JS file will execute "client side" or in the browser or user's computer

**JavaScript Execution**

There is **no "main method"**
* The script file is executed from top to bottom
There's **no compilation** by the developer
* JavaScript is compiled and executed on the fly by the browser, a process called **just-in-time(JIT) compilation**

## **A first JavaScript App**

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>First JS Example</title>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

## **Data Types**

## **Variables**

# Class Notes

## **NVM (Node Version Manager)**
NVM or Node Version Manager is used to allow multiple versions of Node in case of version conflicts. It also is in general a good manager of versions to keep up to date

* `nvm use number` where number is the version number will switch between versions

**Install and Update**

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash`

`nvm install node` Can be specific mention after node

## **JS Coding Notes**

* CamelCase is expected in JS however it works either way.

* Blocks in JS are declared using {} and can still access things declared in the file scope and other scopes
  * However using `let` to declare variables instead will keep variables only in scope declared 

* `console.log` - Print for JS

* `<script src="script.js"></script>` - No space after src

* Typing `node` allows to write JS in the console

* ctrl C to quit the console 

* Can run just like in python using `node file.js`

* `const` enforces a variable to be constant and also follows ryules of `let`

* `str` has a set of attributes then can be used to manipulate it

* To do an interpolated string between two back apostrophes  
  ```javascript
  console.log(`Message: ${5 * 10}`)
  ```

* JS has no ints, just floats 

* Post increment `x++` and post increment `++x` can be used for singular increments. However post will print x before the increment.

* JS will attempt to do automatic type conversion `console.log("123" == 123)`
  * `===` will supress the type conversion 

* When using dicts in JS this is the syntax. Can use dot notation and no `''` for the key tag.
  ```javascript
    person = {
        name: 'Matt',
        age: 50
    }
    console.log(person.name)
  ```

* Lists in python can be a mix of data types

### **Day 2**

* Can store functions as variables using an arrow function
  ```javascript
    function add(x, y) {
      return x + y
  }
  // same as below
  const add = x, y =>  x + y

  console.log(add(5,10))
  ```
  * However an arrow function has a shortcut for writing

* `console.log (numbers.map(double))` the `.map()` function will read throgh an array and then use the parameter written in the parantheses (functions/scripts/etc can go in it)

* Calling function from variables
  ```javascript
  const Utils = {
      add: (x, y) => x + y,
      doubler: arr => arr.map(x => x * 2)
  }

  console.log (Utils.add(5, 10))
  console.log(Utils.doubler(numbers))
  ```
  * Instead of mapping if there are multiple things that are related we are able to place them in an object together and use dot notation to use them.
  
* Can assign variables and values in a list through pre assignment
  ```javascript
  const people = ['Matt', 'Glen', 'Mary', 'Kate']

  const [,second, third, ...others] = people

  console.log(second, third, others)
  ```
  * `...` puts the remaining after the selected in an array when used in this context it is called the **rest** operator

* In the context below the `...` is called the **expansion** operator and is splitting up the array into its components and creating a new array with the data from the variables
  ```javascript
  const bobBirds = ['Robin', 'Crew']
  const sallyBirds = ['Bluejay', 'Cardinal']

  const allBirds = [...bobBirds, ... sallyBirds, 'Magpie']

  console.log(allBirds)
  ``` 

**Control Structures**

* JS if is similar however uses `else if` and parameter has to be in parentheses
  ```javascript
  const age = 16

  if (age >= 18) {
      console.log('Adult')
  } else if (age >=13) {
      console.log('Teen')
  } else {
      console.log('Child')
  }
  ``` 
  * It can also be done using a ternary operator such as below
  ```javascript
  const message = age >= 18 ? 'Allowed' : 'Not Allowed'
  ```

* Matching cases are also similar however it will go through each case below the matched case automatically unless a `break` is inserted
  ```javascript
  const favBird = 'Crow'

  switch (favBird) {
      case 'Raven': // Will fall through to 'You like Crows'
      case 'Crow':
          console.log('You like crows!')
          break
      case 'Robin':
          console.log('You like robins!')
          break
      default: 
          console.log('Unknown Bird')
  }
  ```
  * `default` as per the name does not need a break as it's expected to be the last case

* While loops are similar to Python
  ```javascript
    while (count > 0) {
       console.log(count--)
    }
  ````
* For loops in Javascript are a three way situation.
  1. Initialiser - executed once, prior to first iteration
  2. condition - execeuted every iteration, priot tot he iteration
  3. Post-iteration - exected every iteration, after the iteration 
  ```javascript
    for (let i = 1, x=0; i <= 10; i+=2, x++) {
        console.log(i,x)
    }

    console.log("Fibonacci")
    for (let prev = 1, next = 1; next <= 1000; tmp = next, next = prev + next, prev=tmp) {
        console.log(next)
    }
  ```

  * Using `of` and `in`. When using of it becomes the values, when using in it shows the index value.
  ```javascript
  const favFoods = ['pizza', 'paste', 'tacos']
    // for food in favFoods:
    for (let food of favFoods) {
        console.log(food)
    }
  ```
  * Instead of doing below to get index and value
  ```javascript
    for (let index in favFoods) {
      console.log(`{parseInt(index)+1}. ${favFoods[index]}`)
  }
  ```
  * There is a method `.foreach(current element, index value, array being iterated)` that can take callback function. 
  ```javascript
    favFoods.forEach((food, index) => {
      console.log(`${index+1}. ${food}`)
  })
  ```

**Classes**

* In JS don't need to create a class for an object, can just create an object by itself. 
  * Therefore what can be done is create an empty object then add the variables to it. This below is a prototype
```javascript
const person = {}
person.name = 'Matt'
person.age = 50

console.log(person)    
```
Option 2 - Constructor version
```javascript
javascript
const person = new Object()
person.name = 'Matt'
person.age = 50

console.log(person)    
```

Option 3

```javascript
function Person(name, age ) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
}

const person = new Person('Matt', 50)

console.log(person)
```
* Object is a data type in JS so there is a constructor function that can be called to create new instance 
* In JS no classes are created only objects that things are added to.
* These objects also have their own scope
* In this code below when being called best practice is to explicitly write `this` to show intent of accessing the specific object
```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
    this.greet = () => {
        console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age} years old.`)
    }
}

const person = new Person('Matt', 50)

person.greet()
```
* Best practice now for making the prototypical object is using the class syntax
* The keyword `constructor` method is used to initualise the object and set it's initial state
```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name
        this.age = age
    }

    greet() {
      console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age}`)
    }
}

const person = new Person('Matt', 50)

person.greet()
console.log(person)
```
* In the script below `rect.area = 5` will not change the answer because no setter is provided for the change
```javascript
class Rectangle {
    constructor(width, height){
        this.width = width
        this.height = height
    }

    get area () {
        return this.width * this.height
    }
}

const rect = new Rectangle(10,20)
rect.area = 5
console.log(rect.area())
```
* Achieving private in classes in JS is done with `#` key. Below the key is used to replace where width is and does not allow it to be changed from the outside and if console.log was `.#width` it will not work. `.width` will show the value set by the const.
* Value below is what is placed in `rect.width` and is denied because it is not a typeof `number`. Can be used since it is a keyword of a datatype in JS
```javascript
class Rectangle {
    #width
    #height

    constructor(width, height){
        this.#width = width
        this.#height = height
    }

    get area () {
        return this.#width * this.#height
    }

    get width (){
        return this.#width
    }

    set width(value) {
        if (typeof value === 'number'){
            this.width = value
        }
    }
}

const rect = new Rectangle(10,20)
rect.width = "Hi"
console.log(rect.area)
```
* This square class is calling from the Rectangle class above and JS will automatically deduce where super is coming from
```javascript
class Square extends Rectangle {

    constructors(size) {
        super(size, size)
    }
}
```
