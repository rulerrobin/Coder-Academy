## **What is JavaScript**

* Dynamically-typed (like Ruby or Python)
* Interpreted or JIT-compiled
* The only language a web browser natively understands
* Syntax inspired by C / C++ / Java
* Client (web browser) or server-side (via NodeJS)
* Required knowledge of all web developers

**History**

* Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich (co-founder of Mozilla)
* Javascript has nothing to do with Java
  * Named this way for marketing reasons
* The first version was written in 10 days 
* Several fundamental language decisions were made because of company politcs and not technical reasons

`" I was under marketing orders to make it look like Java but not make it too big for it's britches... [it] needed to be a silly little langauge."`

## **Javascript in the browser**

**Code in Web Pages**

HTML can embed JavaScript files in to the web page via the `<script>` tag.

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>CS 193X</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
        <script src="filename.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    ... contents of the page...
    </body>
</html>
```

**How does JavaScript get loaded?**

1. The browser parses the HTML file and finds a `<script>` tag
2. Browser makes a request to server for the `script.js`file
3. Server responds with JavaScript file just like it would with CSS or image files
4. Now once it loads the JS file will execute "client side" or in the browser or user's computer

**JavaScript Execution**

There is **no "main method"**
* The script file is executed from top to bottom
There's **no compilation** by the developer
* JavaScript is compiled and executed on the fly by the browser, a process called **just-in-time(JIT) compilation**

## **A first JavaScript App**

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>First JS Example</title>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

## **Data Types**

## **Variables**

# Class Notes

* CamelCase is expected in JS however it works either way.

* Blocks in JS are declared using {} and can still access things declared in the file scope and other scopes
  * However using `let` to declare variables instead will keep variables only in scope declared 

* `console.log` - Print for JS

* `<script src="script.js"></script>` - No space after src

* Typing `node` allows to write JS in the console

* ctrl C to quit the console 

* Can run just like in python using `node file.js`

* `const` enforces a variable to be constant and also follows ryules of `let`

* `str` has a set of attributes then can be used to manipulate it

* To do an interpolated string between two back apostrophes  
  ```javascript
  console.log(`Message: ${5 * 10}`)
  ```

* JS has no ints, just floats 

* Post increment `x++` and post increment `++x` can be used for singular increments. However post will print x before the increment.

* JS will attempt to do automatic type conversion `console.log("123" == 123)`
  * `===` will supress the type conversion 

* When using dicts in JS this is the syntax. Can use dot notation and no `''` for the key tag.
  ```javascript
    person = {
        name: 'Matt',
        age: 50
    }
    console.log(person.name)
  ```

* Lists in python can be a mix of data types

## **NVM (Node Version Manager)**
NVM or Node Version Manager is used to allow multiple versions of Node in case of version conflicts. It also is in general a good manager of versions to keep up to date

* `nvm use number` where number is the version number will switch between versions

**Install and Update**

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash`

`nvm install node` Can be specific mention after node
