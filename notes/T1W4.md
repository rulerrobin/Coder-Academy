# **Week 2 Notes**

### Python 

It's important to use a virtual environment for Python (windows) instead use wsl/ubuntu to install using python3 import 

* When using the venv, never touch the venv source folder

`{}` Can be used to insert expressions into print(), for example:

```python
celsius = input()

fahrenheit = (int(celsius)*9/5) + 32

print (f"The result is: {fahrenheit}.")
```

OR

```python
my_age = input('What is your age?')

print (f'You will be {int{my_age} + 10 } years old in 10 years')
```

The f above tells python it is a formatted string, meaning it allows variables to be added. So ther is no need to do something like below.

```python
print('You will be' + str(int(my_age) + 10) + ' in 10 years')
```

`elif` means to say that if the above is true then skip this block of code.
