# **Week 2 Notes**

### Python 

It's important to use a virtual environment for Python (windows) instead use wsl/ubuntu to install using python3 import 

* When using the venv, never touch the venv source folder

`{}` Can be used to insert expressions into print(), for example:

```python
celsius = input()

fahrenheit = (int(celsius)*9/5) + 32

print (f"The result is: {fahrenheit}.")
```

OR

```python
my_age = input('What is your age?')

print (f'You will be {int{my_age} + 10 } years old in 10 years')
```

The f above tells python it is a formatted string, meaning it allows variables to be added. So ther is no need to do something like below.

```python
print('You will be' + str(int(my_age) + 10) + ' in 10 years')
```

`elif` means to say that if the above is true then skip this block of code.

Can combine statements with conditional statements such as below

```python
a = 20
b = 30

x = 'A is greater' if a > b else 'B is greater or equal'
#or
print ('A is greater' if a > b else 'B is greater or equal')
```

Variables are not transmitted between `or` and `and`
```python
if name == 'a' or 'b': #does not work
if name == 'a' or name 'b' #does work
```
However what you are able to do instead when doing comparions is using `match` instead.
```python
letter = input()
match letter:
    case 'a' | 'b' | 'c'
    print('start')
    case 'x' | 'y' | 'z'
    print ('end')
    case _: #default or catch all case if none match
    print('?')
```

The `Pass` statement does nothing, it is used as a place-holer for functions that are yet to be implemented.

Python allows code to be condensed this is called the ternary operator.
```python
day_of_the_week = "Wednesday"

if day_of_the_week == "Wednesday":
    should_water_plants = True
else:
    should_water_plants = False

print("Should water plants today:", should_water_plants)
```
Can be turned into 
```python
day_of_the_week = "Wednesday"
should_water_plants = True if day_of_the_week == "Wednesday" else False

print("Should water plants today:", should_water_plants)
```
When writing `if not` it makes the variable next to it `False`
```python
is_senior = True
ticket_price = 100 if not is_senior else 200
```
