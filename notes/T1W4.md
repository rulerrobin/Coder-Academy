# **Week 2 Notes**

### Python 

It's important to use a virtual environment for Python (windows) instead use wsl/ubuntu to install using python3 import 

* When using the venv, never touch the venv source folder

`{}` Can be used to insert expressions into print(), for example:

```python
celsius = input()

fahrenheit = (int(celsius)*9/5) + 32

print (f"The result is: {fahrenheit}.")
```

OR

```python
my_age = input('What is your age?')

print (f'You will be {int{my_age} + 10 } years old in 10 years')
```

The f above tells python it is a formatted string, meaning it allows variables to be added. So ther is no need to do something like below.

```python
print('You will be' + str(int(my_age) + 10) + ' in 10 years')
```

`elif` means to say that if the above is true then skip this block of code.

Can combine statements with conditional statements such as below

```python
a = 20
b = 30

x = 'A is greater' if a > b else 'B is greater or equal'
#or
print ('A is greater' if a > b else 'B is greater or equal')
```

Variables are not transmitted between `or` and `and`
```python
if name == 'a' or 'b': #does not work
if name == 'a' or name 'b' #does work
```
However what you are able to do instead when doing comparions is using `match` instead.
```python
letter = input()
match letter:
    case 'a' | 'b' | 'c':
        print('start')
    case 'x' | 'y' | 'z':
        print ('end')
    case _: #default or catch all case if none match
        print('?')
```

The `Pass` statement does nothing, it is used as a place-holer for functions that are yet to be implemented.

Python allows code to be condensed this is called the ternary operator.
```python
day_of_the_week = "Wednesday"

if day_of_the_week == "Wednesday":
    should_water_plants = True
else:
    should_water_plants = False

print("Should water plants today:", should_water_plants)
```
Can be turned into 
```python
day_of_the_week = "Wednesday"
should_water_plants = True if day_of_the_week == "Wednesday" else False

print("Should water plants today:", should_water_plants)
```
When writing `if not` it makes the variable next to it `False`
```python
is_senior = True
ticket_price = 100 if not is_senior else 200
```

### Functions
---

As well as keeping our code DRY, functions can be used as an abstraction. An abstraction essentially hiding away the details of some hard to understand process - like an algorithm - into some easy to recall shorthand. Functions are abstractions because they can contain a lot of complexity but be called, invoked, or executed (these all mean the same thing) by an easy to remember name.

Since Python is an interpreted language definitions have to go at the top and the main code is below it. 
```python
def hello(name):
    print (f'Hello {name}')

#main
hello('Matt')
```
Local variables mean that only the function that holds it can see it, global variables are accessible throughout the code.

Arguments are in the functions called so `hello()` and parameters are in the defined function `def hello()`. You are unable to force a data type into a parameter however you can write code to validate the data type.

**Positional arguments** are based on parameters and arguments based on position/order. 
```python
def hello(name, age):
#main
hello('Matt', '50')
```
**Keyword arguments** are based on the names of parameters and arguments. If there is a default value should be named so others are able to tell where it's from or comment.
```python
def hello(name, age):
#main
hello(name, age)
```
You are able to mix and match however positional arguments have to go first and then keyword arguments.

```python
# add gst to an amount and return the result
def add_gst(amount):
    #sect local variable to the gst rate
    gst_rate = 0.1
    #calculate amount plus gst and return the result
    return subtotal + (subtotal * gst_rate)

#read subtotal from user and convert to float
subtotal = float (input ('Subtotal: $'))
# call add_gst, passing input subtotal as argument
# store returned result in a new variable called total
total = add_gst(subtotal)
# print out total
print(f'total: ${total:.2f}')
```
In a Boolean expression, 0 evaluates to false. If not number = 0 which means if not number says if number is false which is zero in boolean after mod of 3 then return true. Below example tests if number is visible by 5 or 3.
```python
def factor_check(number):
    if not number:
        return False
    if not number % 3:
        return True
    if not number % 5:
        return True
    return False
```
## Libraries
---
There are libraries that youi are able to use through `import` that are built into python for example `import random`. They also tend to have methods within them when used. For example `8_ball (random.randint(1,6))`
