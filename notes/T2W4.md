## Class Notes

Instead of repeating the same URL prefix into the routes, because we assume that the blueprint pages all have same prefix due to being related to the one area, an extra parameter is included in the blueprint register. `url_prefix='/route'`.

```python
cards_bp = Blueprint('card', __name__, url_prefix='/cards')

@cards_bp.route('/')
```

To link, set up FK in the model of owned cards to the owner user.

In CLI commands when coding it in, the owner is the FK that is placed into the owned model? and owner has to be seeded first.

```python

user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False) # owner is made into FK

# In other file User must be commited before the cards due to user ID nullable = False
db.session.query(User).delete()
db.session.add_all(users)
db.session.commit()


# initial cards has user ID added so it does not error
cards = [
    Card(
        title = 'Start the project',
        description = 'Stage 1 - Create an ERD',
        status = "Done",
        date_created = date.today(),
        user_id=users[0].id
    ),
```
