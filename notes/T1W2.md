# **Week 2 Notes**

## **Flexbox**

* Without `display: flex` it will not accomodate size changes, it changes style to make sure it works well on any device
* 2 Axis to think about when using flex `flex-direction: row;` or `flex-direction: column;`
* `flex-wrap: wrap;` will wrap the content back around
* **`flex-flow: pos pos;` combines `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` e.g. `flex-flow: row wrap;`
* `justify-content: pos;`  (start, end, center, space-around, space-between)allows to determine how to align elements depending on the axis
* `align-items: pos;` does the same thing as justify-content however it is for `flex-direction: column` (unable to see without mutliple rows)

Use a **[cheatsheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)** as there are several different ways to move and align elements.

**Centering a single element**
```html
<style>
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
</style>
```

## **Responsive Design**

### **What is Responsive Design**
It solves a problem that screens nowadays have different sizes. Websites then need to be accomodating to these differences.
* Phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, projectors, watches, etc

### **Responsive Design Tools**
* Optimization of HTML with viewport size
* Start using percentages for sizing
* Media breakpoints allow changes depending on size and width of screen
* Flexbox and Frameworks

### **Mobile First**
Mobile is designed first because it can scale up to a desktop device. If a website fits on a mobile device, it's easier to fit onto a desktop.

### **Demo**
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

This meta tag is used to notify css to modify depending on the viewport size fo the user.

#### **Percentages**
When using static values it's always the best idea because it does not account for user's screen. Instead percentages may be used e.g. `width: 100%;` meaning 100% of the viewport

### **Media Breakpoints**
Changing size of text depending on viewport or size of screen. 
```html
<style>
    @media screen and (max-width: 600px) p {
        font-size: 20px;
    }
</style>

<style>
    /* @media screen and (sizing) selector {
        styles
    } */
</style>
```
Above code says that the media selected will change to size depending on the size of the viewport `(max-width: 600px)`. It is also still apart of styling so can make multiple changes to style or selectors.
