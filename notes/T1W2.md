# **Week 2 Notes**

## **Flexbox**

* Without `display: flex` it will not accomodate size changes, it changes style to make sure it works well on any device
* 2 Axis to think about when using flex `flex-direction: row;` or `flex-direction: column;`
* `flex-wrap: wrap;` will wrap the content back around
* `justify-content: pos;`  (start, end, center, space-around, space-between)allows to determine how to align elements depending on the axis
* `align-items: pos;` does the same thing as justify-content however it is for `flex-direction: column`

**Centering a single element**
```html
<style>
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
</style>
```
