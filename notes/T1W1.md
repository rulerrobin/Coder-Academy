# **Week 1 Notes**

## **Terminal Basics**

Terminal is an application that allows users to access computers and files without having to use GUI and access to things that are only accessible to CLI. Most code will be executed and run through terminal.

### **Commands List**

| Command | Use | Examples |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| `pwd `| shows the current location (print working directory) |
| `mkdir` | creates a folder (mkdir 'folder name') |
| `cd `| change directory |
| `cd .` | . is placeholder for current directory | 
| `cd ..` | .. is to previous directory |
| `ls `| lists out folders and files in the current directory |
| `touch` | makes a file | touch filename.txt |
| `more `| shows contents of file | more filename.txt
| `mv `| moves file contents from 1 file name to another essentially moving | can move files into folders e.g. mv file folder
| `clear` | clears out the terminal |
| `cp `| is a copy function | cp filename.txt newfilename.txt |
| `rm `| deleting files function | rm filename.txt |
| `rm - rf` | delete directories/folders | rm - rf folder |
| `man `| shows user manual for terminal | 
| `echo `| outputs on terminal | echo text |  
| `nano `| can be used to view/edit contents of a file | 
| `cat `| prints content of file |

* Example with . and .. you are able to use . to say current directory e.g. cd ./folder/folder. You are also able to combine . and .. cd ./../..

* mv you.txt ../ moves file up one for example

* When moving between files and folders if there is a space must use quotation marks either singele or double

* echo can also be used to output the text into a new file

* when using echo if >> is put in front the content will be appended on

## **Git Basics**

Topics
* Version Control
* Git vs GitHub
* Core Git Concepts
* Demo

### **Version Control**
Due to the nature of work it ends up being that there will be many files and many versions of files. Version control solves the problem of people working on files at the same time and multiple versions. It keeps track of who is making what changes and resolve conflicts between conflicting changes.

It's more of a tool that keeps code organised.

* Keeps track of large groups of files
* Popular systems (Git, SVN, Mercurial)

#### **Git and GitHub**

| Git | GitHub |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Version Control System | Web app owned by MS |
| Runs locally on your computer | Wraps useful functionality around Git | 
| Open Source | A Cloud repository | 

Git is the system that is used and GitHub is the web app that allows collaboration.

#### **Core Git Concepts**

##### **Repository**

A folder where all the files are stored. 

##### **Staging Area**

A container where we store files we want to change or are making changes to. Where the files from the repository go that are pulled to make changes.
**
##### **Commit**

A bookmark where all changes to files in the staging are stored and saved. Commit takes snapshot and puts changes into a log.

##### _**Pull from repository -> Stage -> Commit to go back to repository**_

### **Commands List**

| Command | Use | Examples |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| `git init` | initialises git in the directory |  |
| `git status` | shows what branch, commits, files in staging area or not |
| `git add` | adds file to staging area | git add filename |
| `git commit -m` | makes changes -m is a message about the changes made | If you forgot the -m you should be able Ctrl X or Q to get out out NANO |
| `git log` | logs of all changes that have been made |
| `git diff` | shows changes made |

* can still use . for current directory as a shortcut e.g. git add .

## **General Notes**

Origin means the local working repository, however when it says `origin/main` it means that it is being worked on the remote repo.
Working tree clean means there is nothing staged to commit any changes. 
fork - create own remote repo from someone else's with all of the hjistory up tht etime of the fork
clone - coipy of the contents of a remote repo to your local repo and working directory
master/main- default branch on a repo
origin - default name of the connection the remote repo
## **Markdown**

Markdown is a mark up language that is highly compatible with HTML and is a major part of how websites and apps are actually seen.

* in VS Code can use CTRL SHIFT V as a preview window
* using ! before a link turns the link into viewer for images 

### **Commands List**

Use Markdown cheatsheet as not too much too search through

## **HTML**

`<!--comment-->` is a comment (ctrl + /)
For basic boiler plate can use ! and then enter to autofill.

Some elements in HTML are inline - appearing one beside the other and others are in block (one below the other). This can be changed using CSS.

#### **To View use - http://localhost:portnumber bottom right**

### **What is HTML**
* Is markup language used to tell browser how to display content
* Tags are the way content is marked up
* A forward slash indicate a closing tag however not all have closing tabs `<tag>content</tag>`

### **Doc Structure**
* When right clicking and inspecting a website it can show you how a website is structured
* `<head>` is used for styling and interacting
* `<body>`contains the content of the page
* `<meta charset="UTF-8">` sets character set used
* `name ="viewport"` is for devices 
* Using browser inspects can use to do some debugging as it won't be updated due to it being on server when refreshed

#### **Doctype Declaration**
* All HTML docs must start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` Declaration as it is info to the browser about what doc to expect. Indicates type of HTML doc
* HTML5 decs are simple: `<!DOCTYPE HTML>`
* `<html><head><body>` are the three main tags in a HTML doc

`<head>`
* Contains data that is not shown on the page, however it has metadata, title and styling info

`<body>`
* represents the contenty that is visible on the web page

### **Basic HTML Tags**

`<heading>`
* Shows headings and goes up to `<h7></h1>`

`<p>`
* Paragraph or text content

`<img src="link"/>`
* Used for images and `src` is an additional attribute for whhere to source image

`<a href="link">Text linked to hyperlink</a>`
* link tag a meaning attribute `href` meaning hyperlink reference

`<br><br>`
* Essentially a double space or enter

`<ul></ul>` and `<ol></ol>`
```html
<ul> 
    <li>coding<li>
    <li>gaming<li>
</ul>
```
* `<ul>` meaning unordered list and `<ol>` meaning ordered list (numbered)

### **Absolute and Relative Path**

**Absolute Path** Points to the complete path, could be ony link from the internet or for a local file all the way from root directory.
e.g. `<a href = "htpps://www.google.com/">Google</a>` directly to google or 

**Relative Path** Points to another file location with respect of current file through directories etc. Always navigates to a relative folder then to file
e.g. `<img src = "img/kitty.jpg">`

Can add `alt` as an alternate attribute which means if image or link is broken it will show as the alt text. e.g. `<img src="img/kitty.jpg" alt ="kitten"/>`

### **Link Different Pages**

**ID** Used to anchor to different secions of the same page. Usually represented with a # at the front e.g. `#page title` and within the tag itself `<h1 id="heading">Heading 1</h1>`

Below Shows footer linking to below footer and heading linking to heading.

````html
        <h1 id="heading">Heading 1</h1>
        <a href="#footer">footer</a>

        <h1 id = "footer">Footer</h1>
        <a href ="#heading">back to Top</a>

````
**Relative Paths** Used to link different html pages. 

* Relative pathing means need to show path but can use . as a shortcut

```` 
<a href="./contact.html">Contact page</a>
````

### **Semantic Tags**

Clearly describle its meaning to bnoth browser and developer. INstead of `<div>` and `<span>` saying nothing about the content while `<form>`, `<table>` and `<article>` clearly define the content.

In html there are several semantic tags check [cheat sheet](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp).

## **CSS Basics**

#### **CSS Syntax**
```html
        <style>
            /* element,
            element 2{
                property: value;
            }   */
            /* can do multiple elements at once with comma */
            h1 {
                color: #ad3103;
                text-align: center;
            }
        </style>
```
Can also set as multiple classes.
`<div class ="box square"></div>`

![Syntax](./prework/CSS%20Basics/Selectors.png)
### **What is CSS**

```html
<title>CSS Intro</title>
        <style>
            /* element{
                property: value;
            }   */
            h1 {
                color: #ad3103;
                text-align: center;
            }
            .sub-title{
                color: blue;
                font-size: 20px;
            }
            #title{
                color: green;
                font-size: 40px;
                border: 2px solid red;
            } 
            button:hover{
                background-color: pink;
            }
        </style>
    <body>
        <h1 id ="title">Intro to CSS</h1>
        <h2 class = "sub-title"> sub heading</h2>
        <h2 class = "sub-title"> sub heading</h2>
        <h2 class = "sub-title"> sub heading</h2>
        <p class = "sub-title">this is a para</p>
        <button>Click here</button>

    </body>
```

Stands for Cascading Style sheets and describes the style of a HTML document. 
* A style sheet language
Style sheet helps web devs separate style from the content, this style can be defined *ONCE* and then applied everywhere.
* Cascading implies the latest style overriedes the previous definition

`<style></style>` any styling should be in between the style tags

Classes can be reused and ID's have to be unique.
All classes have a `.` before their name when being referenced whilst classes have a `#`

#### **Style Tags**

* CSS Styless are defined between the `<style><style>` tags
* Color Values should be done through hexcode or rgb, however some can use hsl (hue, saturation, lightness)
* `<link>` tag defines relationship between current doc and external resource
* There are many different types of tags (use a cheatsheet for what you need)

Once the element is defined can continue to make changes to the defined element.

### **Selectors**

* Are how style is applied to different HTML elements

**Types of Selectors** **(Ids, Classes and Pseudo Selectors)**
* Type: Select all elements that have a given node name. (h1, p, img, input, etc)
* Class: Sleects all elements that have the given class attribute (#)
* ID: Selelcts elements that have a given id attribute (.)
* Pseudo Classes: Selects elements based on state information used to define special state of an element. e.g. style an element when mouse hovered

#### **Examples of Pseudo Classes**
A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). They are used heavily in complex animation.

Psuedo-classes are denoted with a single colon.
* `button:hover` when hovering over element
* `li:nth-child(even)` affects every 2nd element
* `a:visited` if user has visited previously


### **Absolute Vs Relative Units**

**Absolute Unit**: refers to a fixed size e.g. px, cm, mm (Not recommended)

**Relative units** are used to create responsive designs that accomodate to different screen sizes.
* % - relative to the size of the parent element (e.g an image that is 50% of the div it exists in)
* VH - relative to the viewport heigh (e.g a landing page that takes up the entire screen of whatever device it is viewed on)
* VW - relative to the viewport width
* EM - relative to the font size of the parent element (e.g a heading that has margin as big as the letters in the heading)
* REM - relative to the font size of the root element (e.g all text in a website having padding the same size as the text)

Changes wrt to size of parent element or screen size e.g. %, rem, em, vw, vh (1em is 16 pixels)

Absolute keeps sizing same no matter changes to window, relative changes to elements on screen and window

### **Inline, Internal and External Stylesheet**

* Inline Stylling: An el;ement inline with html tag
* Internal style sheet: Elements in the same html document, requires a style tag
* External Style Sheet: Elements in a separate css file and link to html document **(Recommended)**

To link an external style sheet 
* Need a link tag and hyperlink reference to location of style sheet

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href = "css/style.css">
```

### **Cascading Specificity**

Way browser calculates which style should apply with a value system as per below to elements.
1. Using **`!important`** at the end of a styling rule will overwrite anything.
2. Inline Style - we can quickly overwrite styling from an externally linked stylesheet by using the style attribute on a HTML element. Also one to be careful with because it's hard to see in the CSS file
3. Id -  Targeting an ID is considered more specific than targeting a class. Useful when creating one off styles
4. Class and Pseudo Class - This is less specific than ID because we can target multiple elements with a class
5. Element - The most generic selector, it could target all elements of that type in your document. So it makes sense that it's easily overwritten.



## **CSS Layout**

### **Block Display vs Inline Display (Main Display Types)**

Main difference is how much space is taken up on the browser. Viewable in inspect.
* Block takes up entire space on browser
* Links only take up the space they need
* Each element has a default display most are block and this is modifiable using style tags
* When changing inline or block display unable to have custom widths and heights they still take the entire display or as much space as they need

Setting display types
* display: block;
* display: inline;

#### **Div and Span**
* `<div><div>` is a general block display
* `<span><span>` is a general inline display

### **Overflow**
* `overflow: hidden;` hides the overflow
* `overflow: scroll;` creates a scrollbar for overflow

### **Positions**

**Static**: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. This is the default value.

**Relative**: Relative to the element's normal position

**Sticky**: Relative to the nearest scrolling ancestor (moves with scroller)

**fixed**: Relative to the viewport

![relative](./prework/Layout/Relative%20Position.PNG)
````html
        <style>
            .box {
                width: 100px;
                height: 100px;
            }
            #box1 {
                background: red
            }
            #box2 {
                background:blue;
                position: relative;
                left:100px;
            }
        </style>
````
**Absolute**: Element is taken out of the flow of document. No longer positions according to nearest element and no longer apart of the board (relative to the first parent whose position is set). Green box no longer takes into account blue box as it is "out" of the flow of the page.

![absolute](./prework/Layout/Absolute%20Positioning.PNG)
````html
        <style>
            .box {
                width: 100px;
                height: 100px;
            }
            #box1 {
                background: red
            }
            #box2 {
                background:blue;
                position: absolute;
                left:100px;
            }
            #box3{
                background: green;
            }
        </style>
````

### **Box Model**
Using inspect can see a box model, the model has 4 parts. Check box-model.html file in `term1/prework/layout`
* **Margin**: All space around the element
* **Border**: Border directly around the element
* **Padding**: Space directly inside the box where content will be located

All aspects affects the size of the element. However att `box-sizing: border-box;` prevents border, margin and padding from tasking up more space.

### **Inheritance**
In CSS, inheritance controls what happens when no value is specified for a property on an element.

Generally the properties that effect typography and spacing are inherited.

CSS properties can be categorized in two types:

* **inherited properties**: default are set to the computed value of the parent element

````html
  <body>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet <strong>consectetur</strong> adipisicing elit.
      Nesciunt, iusto.
    </p>
  </body>
````
Combined with forced to inherit properties from parent element as `<strong>` is within parent element of `<p>`
````css
p {
  color: dodgerblue;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
strong {
  color: initial;
  border: inherit;
}
````

* **non-inherited properties**: default are set to initial value of the property

## **Website Planning**

### **Wireframes**

They are a tool to represent ideas in a simple way. Not meant to be polished or pretty but useful for representing the layout and structure of content.

#### **Types of Wireframes**

1. **Sketched**
Some devs use pencil and paper or drawing first to illustrate a basic concept for fussing with graphical elements.

2. Detailed Hand-Drawn Wireframes**
More detailed version of the sketch however it may be more convenient to use digital tools at this point since hand drawn may be difficult to convert to digital elements.

3. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**
Created to display elements in simple content blocks, taking basic sketch into something more refined, they are important to understand the elements needed and what content needs to be written.
* **Low-Fidelity Mobile Wireframes** are also supported.
* **Low-Fidelity Interactive Wireframes** are those that can be interacted with

4. **High-Fidelity Wireframes**
Illustrates in more detail without too many graphical elements resulting in a more pleasing look without time consuming design work.

5. **Wireframe Mockup**
Once design has been approved, a mockup can be used through creation of graphical elements to finish design.
* **Interactive Wireframe Mockup** can be created without making the actual site with UI and graphical elements. Useful in pipeline as helps developers and designers be on the same page for look and functionality.

6. **Free Website Wireframes**
There are several different free tools for wireframing for example [Miro](https://miro.com/features/). In particular this gives wireframe elements for low - medium mockups.
* **Mobile Website Wireframes** are very important to test as well for responsiveness of the site. There are a few approaches to this from, condensing the details to limiting the functionality.

### **Effective Wireframes**
They should be easy to read and also convey a lot of information.
* About about the elements needed. (Structure, layout, spacing, and sizing)
* Should be able to convey flow of the website (AKA Wireflow)
* Dynamic content should be noted (unnecessary to create multiple frames for multiple sizings)
* Leave colors, fonts and more detailed information to a high-fidelity wireframe. 

Only annotate what is needed and keep explanations brief, its supposed to be drafted quickly!

## **Color Theory and Moodboards**

### **What are moodboards?**
In a nutshell, moodboards help you represent things that make you think of something. Any items that help you understand and think about your goal.

### **Color Theory**
Color theory is essentially the theory of using colors to influence design and in turn influencing people subconciously through feelings or thought. For example the color of blue is used to represent officework, military etc. The color red is used for speed, hunger, power. 
* Color palette ai's have been available for a few years to use.
