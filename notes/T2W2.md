## Computer Science Fundamentals

Why is this important?

CS fundamental skills are crtical for any kind of progamming. In this course we focus on skills in the areas of: 
* Logic 
* Data Sctrucutres
* Algorithms

Every programmer must at lewast be familair with the topics awe cover to be effective and able ot advance their understanding of programming.

## Number Systems(bases)

### What is base?

**Base** (or radix) is simply the number of digits that a number sytem has.

There are other number systems that have a different **base**.

**Decimal** (base 10) has 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

![Alt text](imgs/decimal_base_system.PNG)

The reason we know that 123 is 123 in decimal is from the above image, with the 10's multiplied by the number.

**Binary** (base 2) has 2 digits: 0, 1

![Alt text](imgs/binary_base_system.PNG)

We know the number similar to the decimal system because it is multiplied but by using 2's instead of 10's

**Hexadecimal** (base 16) has 10 digits and 6 letters: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 AND A, B, C, D, E, F

![Alt text](imgs/hexadecimal_base_system.PNG)

Same however it uses 16 because it is base 16. Starting from A count goes to 10 - 15 from A to F.

Converting hex to binary is quite easy because they map perfectly as seen in the image below. 

![Alt text](imgs/convert_hex_to_binary.PNG)

### Converting from decimal to Binary

Generally the moethod from converting any base 10 (decimal) is to divide the number by the base. Keep dividing until the resulting quotient is a valid digit in the base (less tahn the base). The converted number starts with the final whole number and ends with the first remainder.

Meaning in below example last quotient is 1 therefore it starts with a 1 and the first remainder is 1 so it also ends in a 1. 

Another way of thinking about the order is that when doing the divisions is the first division is the first 2^0 and so on.


![Alt text](imgs/decimal_to_binary.PNG)

In this image remainer is 1 in 29/2 so thats the first one. THe next one is 14/2 which is remainder 0 and so on and so forth. This continues until 1 is lower than 2 so the conversion division is complete.

**Alternatively**

You are able to convert by checking the highest power that is able to fit in the the quotient and placing a 1 or 0 depending on the places and quotient. For example below using the number 25.

![Alt text](imgs/decimal_to_binary_alternative.PNG)

### Converting from decimal to Hexadecimal

Same order.

![Alt text](imgs/decimal_to_hex.PNG)

### Counting in other bases

![Alt text](imgs/Other_bases.PNG)

Counting in other bases is done by going up to the number and then going up to next 10's. 
* Base 13 uses ABC to do up to 13 base and then goes back to 10

### Adding Binary Numbers

Addition is the same however carrying numbers over is only done with 1's because 1 is the max number. Therefore a 2 carries the one over to the next line.

![Alt text](imgs/binary_adding.PNG)

### Final Thoughts
* Always keep in mind what the number might be represeting
* Each digit in a number represents the value in that positiion times the power of the base for htt position
* TO convert from decimal to another base, we divide the decimal number y the base
* To convert from another base to decimal, we mulitply each place value by the power of the base for that position, then sum the results
* When we count in a base we can use only digits that are less than the base value
* When converting from 2 non decimal bases, use decimal as a middle meeting point to convert from one to another.

## Boolean Logic

A branch of mathematics that involves boolean values and operations on boolean values. It is used to break down ecomplex problems, and is the heart of computer science.

In Boolean Logic, boolean values may be expressed as TRUE and FALSE.

### Boolean Relations and Operators

**NOT relation and operators**

A unary relation (meaning that it is evaluated on one expression on one expression instead of one).

NOT gives the opposite of the value on which it is applied. (NOT true = false)

Symbols that denote NOT:

![Alt text](imgs/NOT_Operators.PNG)

**AND relation and operators**

Both values must be true for AND to evaluate true.

![Alt text](imgs/AND-operators.PNG)

**OR Relation and operators**

One or the other of the values must be true for OR to evaluate to true (at least one)

![Alt text](imgs/OR_operator.PNG)

**XOR relation and operators**

One or the other value **BUT NOT BOTH** must be true for XOR to evaluate to true

![Alt text](imgs/XOR_Operator.PNG)

### **Implication**

Says that if p is true, then q is true. It is only false when p is true and q ise false. Written as: P -> q

If pp is false, q can be either true or false and the implication is still true.

An implication is True unless you can prove that it is false:  So p=>q will always be true unless there is a case where p is true and q was not true, because that disproves the implication that if p is true then q will also be true.

In use cases it can be used where q should be true if p is true in a code test and if not what is the case where it isn't.

![Alt text](imgs/Implication.PNG)

### **Equivalence**

Q is true if and only if P is true written as p <-> q.

Either both p and q are true or both are false for equivalence to evaluate to true.

![Alt text](imgs/equivalence.PNG)

## Logic Statements

Used to express complex logic statements with a combination of symbols and logical operators.
* NOT an if or ELSE statement, it is more general

 ![Alt text](imgs/logic_statement_example1.PNG)

## Bitwise logical operators

Apply logical oeprations to a series of bits (to a binary number)

![Alt text](imgs/Bitwise_Example1.PNG)

```binary
38 XOR 23

100110
010111
110001

32+16+1 = 49
```

## Sets

A group of unique items from some domain or universet set of items.

Examples:
* If domain is all pets, one set in that domain could be: {dog, cat, bird}
* If the domain is the characters in the string "The Bee Buzzed", the set of characters in that domain is {'T','h', 'e', 'b', 'u', 'z', 'd'}
  * Unique characters in the domain

### Set Terminilogy

Domain: Larger collection from which a set is part
Element: An item in a set
Subset: One set is contained within another set(may contain the exact same elements) e.g. a set of containing elements of above sets
Proper subset: One set is contained within another set and does not contain all elements of its superset(not equal)
Superset: One set containing another set
Proper superset: One set contains another set and contains more than that subset

### Combining sets - union (OR)

Contain all elements that appear in either set. However only a single value is kept if value is not unique.

A = {1, 2, 3, 4}

B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

A (union) B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

![Alt text](imgs/combining_sets1.PNG)

### Combining Sets - intersection (AND)

Contain only elements that appear in both sets.

A = {1, 2, 3, 4}

B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

A (intersection) B = {3, 4}

![Alt text](imgs/combining_sets_intersection.PNG)

### Combining Sets - Complement (NOT)

Elements in the domain that are in the domain and not in the set. In this example the set of all the sets in the domain is the superset.

Domain: All Natural(Positive) Numbers < 10
A = {1, 2, 3, 4}

B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

A (complement) B = {7, 8, 9}

Instead of expressing with 

(A (union) B) Difference (A (intersection) B) 

Alternative 

( A Difference B) Union (B Difference A)

![Alt text](imgs/combining_sets_complement.PNG)

### Combining Sets - Difference

All elements in one set that are not in anothjer set.

A = {1, 2, 3, 4}

B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

A (Difference) B = {1, 2} 

Different Expression Challenge: B - A = {5, 6}

![Alt text](imgs/combining_sets_difference.PNG)

### Combining Sets - Symmetric Difference (XOR)

All elements that are in either set but not in both (EXLUSIVE OR)

A = {1, 2, 3, 4}

B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

(A Union B) Difference (A Intersection B) = {1, 2, 5, 6}

Alternatively can be

(A Difference B) Union (B Difference A)

![Alt text](imgs/combining_sets_symmetric_difference.PNG)


![Alt text](imgs/union_intersection_complement.PNG)

![Alt text](imgs/difference_example.PNG)

To note for sets.
* Prpaer has more values

![Alt text](imgs/subset_superset_example.PNG)

### Some common domains and notations

Natural numbers
* N = Integers above zero
* Z = All positive and negative whole numbers

We can say with above:

Z is a proper superset of natural numbers while N is a proper subset of Z

![Alt text](imgs/element_of.PNG)

* The E looking symbol means is element of

### Using Set Notation to Describe a Set

![Alt text](imgs/set%20examples.PNG)

* Set notation `|` is read as "Such that" OR "Where"

1. Answer = Include all values of X where x is an element of Natural numbers and x < 5 => {1, 2, 3, 4}
2. Answer = Include value of X where x is element of integers and x is greater than -3 and less than 3 => {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
3. Answer = x where x is natural number, less than 10, not 1, 2, 3 => {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}


## Big O Notation (algorithm complexity)

Indicate the performance or complexity of of an algorithm, in a worst cast scenario. Typically describtes number of execution steps and not time. Measures the growth of the time taken with respect to the growth of the input data size. 

As the data grows, how quickly do the amount of steps taken grow? And what is the worst possible performance the algorithm could have.

**Common Big O Notation Values**

![Alt text](imgs/big_O_notation_common_values.PNG)

1. Constant: Steps will stay the same no matter how the size changes
2. Logarithmic: As value gets larger and larger the amount of steps becomes smaller relative to growth of data
3. Linear: Algorithm complexity grows at same rate as data
4. Quadratic: 10 items = 100 steps as it's a quadratic algorithm
5. Exponential: Grows very quickly and sometimes too fast for data to be worth it

![Alt text](imgs/big_O_notation_common_values_graphed.PNG)

Time could be time, steps, execution time whilst input is the amount of data being processed.

### What is an algorithm?

A set of steps to solve a problem for any given input.

* Searching algorithm is a set of steps that are executed to find a value in a list of values
* Counting algorithm is a set of steps to count instances of one thing in a group of things
* Sorting algorithm is a set of steps to put a list of things in a specified order

### Big O Explanations

**0(1) - Constant**

If an algorithm takes the same number of steps to solve a rpbolem, regardless of the input it can be called constant.

Example: Python function that returns the first element of a list

```python
def first_element(a_list):
    if a_list and len(a_list) > 0:
        return a_list[0]
    else:
        return None
```

**O(log n) - Logarithmic**

Binary search or merge sort algorithm, or the divide and conquer method. Each time the loop is executed the set or halved, so in worst case algorithm will require log n steps (n is the number of items in the input collection). If there is no value provided in log you assume it is **BASE 2**

Example: Array of 16 elements, binary search will find any given value in at most 4 steps because log,2,16 = 4 (16>8>4>2 answer > 1)

*What is a logarithm?*

A reciprocal of an exponent. Given a base and a value, the logarithm of the value is defined as the index the base value would need to be raised to in orer to get the origin value. (The INDEX)

Example: 2^3 = 8 therefore log,2,8 = 3

![Alt text](imgs/what_is_log.PNG)

*Example Binary Search O(log n) - Logarithmic*

In a binary search the midpoint of a **SORTED ARRAY** is determined and the value being searched is checked against the midpoint. If it is found it is returned, if less than midpoint then halved again on bottom half of array and if top then the top half is kept then halved. This process is repeated until value is found.

**O(n) - Linear**

Requires as many steps as there are values in the input data set in the worst case.

Example: Function that counts the occurrences of a value in a input data set. (Has to go through whole set to check amount of values)

```python
def count_val(data,val):
    count = 0
    for el in data:
        if el == val:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

**O(n^2) - Quadratic (or polynomial)**

In nested loops, we find quadratic algorithsm or polynomial algorithms. These execute some set of actions over the data set up to n times for an n-sized data set.

Example: A function that compares each value to each other value, such as a bubble sort (swapping numbers in wrong order). The below example shows a sort to make sure array goes from lowest to highest.

```python
def basic_sort(data):
    done = False
    while not done: 
        done = True
        for i in range (0, len(data)-1):
            if data[i] > data[i+1]:
                data[i], data[i+1] = data[i+1], data[i]
                done = False
    return data
```

**O(2^n) - Exponential**

In algorithms that call themselves multiple times (recursive) it may become exponential. The time to execute doubles (or more) with each element in the input data set. It calls itself repeatedly.

Example: The fibonacci sequence

```python
def fibonacci(number):
    if number <= 1:
        return number

    return fibonacci(number - 2) + fibonacci(number - 1)
```

**Calculating Big O**

![Alt text](imgs/calcualting_bigO_example.PNG)

What is the complexity of this algorithm?

If n is the number of values in earch array(4)

How many times will we go through the inner loop (worst case) n = 4

How many times will we go through the outer loop (worst case) n = 4

So therefore with the above example it would be 4^4 or n*n or big O = O(n^2) therefore being quadratic.

This helps because it shows how the equation will be written so therefore we know how it is executed until a new algorithm is implemented or made.

**Right so we can use this to figure out the efficiency and then make new ones using this information**

## Matrices

A matrix is a two dimensional array of numbers. 
* 2 Rows and 3 Columns (2 x 3) Element are noted as below (Zero indexed like arrays but can start at 1):
* Rows first and then columns
* Written as a nested list and accessed in the same way as a list

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_example.PNG)

They are useful data structures as they can are used to solve some problems such as math problems. 

Example: ONline shop sells 3 styles of shirts with each costing a different price. Total sales over a period of time would use matrix maths.

**Addition**

Requires that matrices are the same dimensions i.e same number of rows and columns. Just add each element from each matrix and store the sum in the result matrix.

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_addition.PNG)

**Subtraction**

Requires same as addition however it is subtracted instead of added.

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_subtraction.PNG)

**Scalar Multiplication**

Scalar multiplication means to multiply the matrices using a constant. Mutliply each term/element in the matrix by constant to get result. 
* Written by constant x Matrix as below

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_scalar_multiplication.PNG)

**Multiplication (dot product)**

Two matrices mulitplied together is called **dot product**. Multiply each row of the first matrix with the elements of each column in the second column. 
* Result will have the same number of rows as the first matrix and same number of columns as the second matrix.
* Dot product comes from how it is usually indicated using a .(dot)

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_multiplication_dot_product.PNG)

Requirements are that the number of columns of the 1st matrix equals the number of rows of the 2nd matrix. It does not require the number of rows in the first matrix is equal to the number of columns in the second matrix. 

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_multiplication_dot_product2.PNG)

How this works is in the image below.

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_multiplication_dot_product3.PNG)

**Transposing**

Swapping rows and columns as below. 

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_transposing.PNG)

This can be useful in the below example:

Prices are given by following matrix in a t-shirt shop:

[style 1 style 2 style 3] = [ $5 $8 $9]

Over 5 days sales were made. 

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_shirt_example.PNG)

Now multiplication here would be needed however it is not possible in this form due to the columns and rows not matching.

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_shirt_example2.PNG)

This is then fixed using transposing as done here.

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_shirt_example3.PNG)

From this using matrix multiplication can be done for each day. 

![Alt text](imgs/matrix_shirt_example4.PNG)

## Graphs

Representation of pairwise relationship between objects. Objects are represented as nodes and relationships by edges.

They are used to represent many things - roads connecting cities, links between users in a application, websites connected via hyperlinks, computers connected on a network etc. 

This representation can be used to find a path between objects and optimise the paths between objects. They are used to find the efficient paths between two points.

They are used to rank pages by search engines, best routes on network traffics and suggest the best route on roads. There are many applications of graphs and graph theory to solve problems.

**Undirected vs directed graphs**

In a directed graph, all relationships are bidirectional

![Alt text](imgs/undirected_graph.PNG)

In a directed/di graph, relationships are denoted by arrows explicitly.

![Alt text](imgs/directed_graph.PNG)

**Weighted Graph**

Assigns values to edges, these values can be considered when finding the optimal path. These numbers can mean anything in context, such as distance, amounts of roads, time taken, amount of people etc.

![Alt text](imgs/weighted_graph.PNG)

**Tree**

Is an undirected graph which two verticesa re connected by only one path, and every child node as only one parent. A root node has no parent. Leaf nodes have no children. No loops.

![Alt text](imgs/undirected_graph.PNG)

An example of this type of system as a computer file system. The leaf nodes are the files themselves.

![Alt text](imgs/undirected_graph_tree2.PNG)

**Binary Tree**

The binary search tree (BST), the rule is that the left node is less than its parent node. This is used to perform a binary search.

If searching for three, which side is it on? Greater or less than. The book ripping example.

![Alt text](imgs/binary_tree.PNG)

**Representing graphs - Adjacency Matrix**

Make a table or matrix, with a row and column for each node. Indicate with 0 or 1 if an edge exists between each pair of nodes (where row is the origin and column is the destination of a directed edge)

![Alt text](imgs/adjacency_matrix1.PNG)

The above will turn into below using the context from above.

![Alt text](imgs/adjacency_matrix2.PNG)

**Weighted adjacency matrix**

Instead of 0 and 1, weights can be used to specify connections.

![Alt text](imgs/adjacency_matrix_weighted.PNG)

**Edge Lists**

Adjacency or edge lists can also be used to represent a graph. The edge list can be written from below example as. `x = [AB, BA, BD, CA, CD, DB]`.

This is an example of a directed/di graph because some paths are missing (not bidirectional for all)

![Alt text](imgs/edge_list.PNG)

**Adjacency Lists (Weighted, Undirected)**

In an undirected graph, .both directions are included for each edge, BUT weights are specified. 

`x = [A2B, B2A, A3C, C3A, A4D, D4A, B5D, D5B, C2D, D2C]`

![Alt text](imgs/weighted_graph.PNG)

**Drawing a graph from a matrix or list**

From any adjacency list or matrix a graph can be drawn.

`x = [AB, AE, BC, CD, EB]`

![Alt text](imgs/adjacency_matrix_drawn.PNG)

### **Dijsktra's Algorithm**

A common algorithm used to find the shortest path beween one noe in a weighted graph to every other node.

1. Mark current node
2. Update distance for all adjacent nodes with shortest distance from current node (sum of shortest distance for current node and weight of edge connecting the current node to adjacent node)
3. Mark current node as visited
4. The next current node is an unvisited node that currently has the shortest distance
5. Repeat 1-4 until all nodes are marked as visited
6. Start from any node, the shortest opath can be traced backwards to source node.

It can be used to find shortest path between a node and all other nodes in a graph.
* Must map out all nodes each time a modification is made or origin node is changed
* 
![Alt text](imgs/graph_dijkstra.PNG)

**When Dijsktra is not appropriate**

* To find shortest path that visits all nodes
* When there is no specific node given

**ZERO** simple algorithms at the moment for finding shortest path that visits all nodes - it's a hard problem. It can be done with brute force if graph is small enough by checking all paths that visits all nodes and find least expensive. 

* **MACHINE LEARNING** is the best solution to this problem at the moment.

## Functions and Relations

***

**What is a web framework?**
* Provides basic structure and functionality we need to build a web app
* Then add business logics as hooks into framework in order to customise framework to requirements
* A library imports library (module/pack) but the program has control the whole time. In  a framework has control when and where things happen, however we attach **hooks** to customize what happens when something occurs
  * Framework controls the control flow and we just make additions
  * Library we have control and then call when we need them
* Idea is to avoid having to write a lot of boilerplate code every time
*  Several to pick from
   *  Ruby - Rails, Sinatra
   *  C# - .NET
   *  Python - Django, Flask
   *  Javascript - Express, React


# Flask

It is a python web micro-framework meaning that it has everything needed for minimal functionality. To get full functionality plugins are needed, therefore can install only what is needed to get the job done

* Rails et al provide (almost) everythin needed out of the box
* Not a "kitchen sink" framework etc Rails, .NET or Django
  * MVC (Model-View-Coontroller) - Can be overkill for small projects
  * Projects are large (lots of files) and heavyweight (needs lots of server resources)
  * Opinionated - must use subsystems chosen by framework designers (e.g. use a specific ORM to access DB)

Flask is more similar to Sinatra and Express
* Provides basic routing, request/response and a dev server
* Agnostic - Use an DB, templating library, ORM, etc
  * Comes with Jinja templating but can swap in any template library
* Additional functionality can be added with packages
* Build a server from only the components needed
* Not MVC - Strucuture app however you want
* A more lightweight, performant solution
* Idea for building RESTful API's

## Running Flask

Setting up flask is simple, just use pip install while in a .venv so that it doesn't install globally.

`python3 -m venv .venv`

Then install simply using `pip install flask`

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"
```
1. Imported Flask
2. Created an instance of flask 
3. Used the `route()` decorator to tell flask what URL would trigger function
4. The function returns the message we want to display in the user’s browser

To run the actual flask application
`flask --app hello run`

## Debug Mode

The debugger allows executing arbitrary Python code from the browser. It is protected by a pin, but still represents a major security risk. Do not run the development server or debugger in a production environment.

To use debug mode use debug while running the run code.

`flask --app hello run --debug`

## HTML Escaping

Flask has an inbuilt function `escape()` that is used for HTML escaping. It refers to the process of converting special characters such as `<`, `>`, `&`, and `"`, to their html counterparts. 

For example `"Hello"` is converted to `&quot;Hello&quot;`

## Routing

Modern web applications use meaningful URLs to help users.

Use the route() decorator to bind a function to a URL.


## Dynamic Routing

A technique that allows us to specify a URL ppattern rather than hard-coding URLS as a string. To do this and provide smaller reusable code we need to make use of an API client.

**API Clients**: Tool that can be used to send dummy requests to an API and inspect the response that is generated. For example the one used in the current course is POSTMAN.

To understand dynamic routing we need to stop hard-coding the entire route for example `@app.route/users/user_list`. Instead we mark our out URI as a variable with some angled brackets.

`@app.route("/<some_value>")`

* **URI**: Uniform Resource Identifier as an analogy is like a person's name that identifies the person without how to locate them, this is also a persisten identifier that can differentiate and identify files from each other.
* **URL**: Is a subset of **URI's** of which is not persistent, it is like an address that shows the location of the person. Can only be used to identify and locate web pages.

The problem with doing this however is that routes may collide with one another. For example in the below code by using /info while using the some_page function it will execute the info_page function.

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/<some_value>")
def some_page(some_value):
    return f"<p>You gave the value {some_value} in the route!</p>"

@app.route("/info")
def info_page():
    return "<p>This is the info page.</p>"
```

Instead a better way of doing this would be to hard-code to a point, for example hard-code to the page and then place a value. For example in the code below. We could replace `/some_page/<some_value>` with for example `users/<values>`. Meaning it would direct to users and then be a dynamic route from there.

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/some_page/<some_value>")
def some_page(some_value):
    return f"<p>You gave the value {some_value} in the route!</p>"

@app.route("/info")
def info_page():
    return "<p>This is the info page.</p>"
```

### **Dynamic API Routes**

Some notes to consider when using dynamic API routes:
* Unable to use spaces in request route if there is a space need to replace with `%20`
* The abort function is used as practice for error 404 handling
  ```python   
  # If there's no such artist, we return a 404 NOT FOUND error!
    if not art_list:
        abort(404)
    ```
* There is a syntax for including data type in the request `<string:some_string>`
* Strings cannot contain a slash character


## SQLAlchemy

Alchemy allows the data put in a table puts it into a database table. Conversely it also moves the data in the database table into the table in Python object (the model).

To use SQLAlchemy need to use a connection string and create an instance of it.
```python
# protocol+data base adaptor://user:password@hostname:port/database
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql+psycopg2://trello_dev:spameggs123@localhost:5432/trello' 
# has to be exact for it to work  app.config('SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI')

db = SQLAlchemy(app) # create new instance of SQLAlchemy with a connection to the app

```

**Analogy**

You request what you(python data model) want from a waiter(alchemy) the waiter translates this(to sql) bringing back to chef(posgres database result from request) and waiter (SQLAlchemy) translates it back and presents back to you (python data model)

**Setting up a table or Creating a Model**

A model is a basically a class that allows you to create objects BUT a model also creates the structure of that is going to be used as a table and its rows in the database. This is always singular and **NEEDS** to inherit from `db.model` so that it can be used as an SQLAlchemy model. A name can then be set as by default it will use the class name in snake case.

```python
class Card(db.Model): # inheriting from database SQLalchemy structure
    __tablename__ = 'cards' # declare name of table

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) # data type first in .columns then if primary key must specify
    title = db.Column(db.String(100))
    description = db.Column(db.String())
    date_created = db.Column(db.Date())
```

**CLI COMMANDS**

CLI commands are customer COMMAND LINE INTERFACE commands defined in the app files. However they are run in the terminal when needed. 

```python
# just as per sql tables we dropped first we also need to drop the tables whenever created so it becomes a new slate

@app.cli.command('create') # creates CLI customer commands, string can be anything
def create_db():
    db.drop_all() # drops tables for new slate
    db.create_all() # creates the databases that are defined above (as intepreted language)
    print('Tables created successfull')

@app.cli.command('seed') # creates instance of the Card model in memory
def seed_db():
    # created new instance of Card
    card = Card(
        title = 'Start the project',
        description = 'Stage 1 - Create an ERD',
        date_created = date.today()
    )

    # truncate the Card table same as drop table but only deletes records in table as reseeding
    db.session.query(Card).delete() # query asks what model to do it on then delete deletes the rows

    # add card to session (transaction)
    db.session.add(card) # transaction like when buying and card is declined entire transaction is cancelled
    # commit transaction to database 
    db.session.commit()
```

By using `db.session` it ensures statements are all executed (all statements must succeed) if even one fails though the entire database gets rolled back to before the statements begun.

This sytem is called transaction system meaning its step by step. It's called transaction system because -> it's all or nothing for example if buying groceries and items are added to cart, part of the transaction system is to pay however if unable to pay entire transaction is cancelled. They don't automatically get you to pay for the ones you are able to pay for. Instead it is restarted to the beginning or cancelled entirely.

`db.session.add()` adds like a git add
`db.session.commit()` commits the changes

When adding multiple objects you are able to make them into a list to add_all such as below.

```python
@app.cli.command('seed') # creates instance of the Card model in memory
def seed_db():
    # created new instance of Card
    cards = [
        Card(
            title = 'Start the project',
            description = 'Stage 1 - Create an ERD',
            date_created = date.today()
        ),

        Card(
            title = 'ORM Queries',
            description = 'Stage 2 - Implement several queries',
            date_created = date.today()
        ),

        Card(
            title = 'Marshmallow',
            description = 'Stage 3 - Implement jsonify of models',
            date_created = date.today()
        )
    ]

    # truncate the Card table same as drop table but only deletes records in table as reseeding
    db.session.query(Card).delete()

    # add card to session (transaction)
    db.session.add_all(cards)
```

**Prepared statement**: They take an SQL statement and compiles it. 
* Is more secure as the code variables are treated separately stopping SQL injection
* Once query is prepared then next query is run is uses a prepared statement similar to a compiled code. 
* SQL injection is where data is accepted from user/coming in from a route and can be used to execute malicious code such as dropping tables 

```python
@app.route('/cards') # @app.cli.command('all_cards')
def all_cards():
    # GOAL - select * from cards;
    stmt = db.select(Card) # .limit(2) # do a select query from cards limited to 2 # if only 1 its returned as an item/object

    # executes statement above
    # cards = db.session.execute(stmt)  # default tuple
    cards = db.session.scalars(stmt).all() # returns model instances # all will always return a list

    # cards = db.session.scalars(stmt).first() # returns first one

    # print(cards) 

    for card in cards: # loops over 
        print(card.title)
```

* Using a `.limit()` method after function limits the number of results to 2
* There is also a `.where()` method in statements. 

`stmt = db.select(Card).where(db.or_(Card.status != 'Done', Card.id > 2)).order_by(Card.title.desc())`

* the `,` is AND by default but using db.or changes the comma to an OR
* To mix AND + OR together needs to be for example as below.

`.where(<condition1>, db.or_(<condition2>, <condition3>)) would be where condition1 AND (condition 2 or condition 3`



## ORM's or Object Relational Mapping. 

They are used to interact between applications and databases. They make it easier to develop a database as it is written using a programming language instead of plain SQL. It is also helpful as the tables of databases can be considered as objects in OOP apps or models in an MVC application.

**Pros**
* Cleaner and less code than embedded SQL
* High level implementation, no need to worry about how things work, great for connections, migrations seeds.
* Simpler to use as no need to convert table and object
* Code reamins same or minor modifications if database changes

**Cons**
* First stages (Learning and Installing) can be time-consuming
* Still need to know about database and SQL fundamentals
* Complex queries may still need embedding of SQL

**Popular ORM's**

We will be using SQLAlchmey for now.

* SQLAlchemy: Best for Python apps and built in Flask
* Hibernate: MOost used for Java developers
* Mongooese: Used in Noke.js for an easy manamgement of MongoDB
* Sequelise: Node.js ORM as well, for relational databases
* Active Record: The built in ORM for Ruby on Rails.

### Database Connection and Models

When making a new database it is good practice to create a user that can handle the database but doesn't have access to the rest of the database.
1. Make the user `CREATE USER db_dev WITH PASSWORD '123456';`
2. Grant Permissions `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE trello_clone_db TO db_dev;` 

**Database Connection**

In Flask `Pyschopg` is needed as it is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. `python3 -m pip install pyscopg2`

SQLAlchemy is also needed as the ORM `python3 -m pip install flask-sqlalchemy`

To use create the connection create an instance of it.
```python
# protocol+data base adaptor://user:password@hostname:port/database
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql+psycopg2://trello_dev:spameggs123@localhost:5432/trello' 
# has to be exact for it to work  app.config('SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI')

db = SQLAlchemy(app) # create new instance of SQLAlchemy with a connection to the app
```

## Marshmallow

Similar to SQLAlchemy it cannot be used straight out of the box, needs to be instanced to jsonify.
`pip install flask-marshmallow`

As with the previous installs, also need to import and create an instance of it.
```python
from flask_marshmallow import Marshmallow
ma = Marshmallow(app)
```

Are able to make multiple schemas depending on what is wanted to be returned as jsonify. For example one can be used for descriptions and another can be used for titles.

```python
class CardSchema(ma.Schema):
    class Meta:
        # Fields to expose
        fields = ("id", "title", "description", "date", "status", "priority")
```
The schema (columns) are provided in the fields list. The naming convention of schemas is to put table name and then Schema, always using the instane in the parameter so it knows what it does.

```python
#single card schema, when one card needs to be retrieved
card_schema = CardSchema()
#multiple card schema, when many cards need to be retrieved
cards_schema = CardSchema(many=True)
```

By using marshmallow we are now able to view the data in postman or the browser.

By default marshmallow will also return the details by ascending order of keys.
