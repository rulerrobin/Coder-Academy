## Computer Science Fundamentals

Why is this important?

CS fundamental skills are crtical for any kind of progamming. In this course we focus on skills in the areas of: 
* Logic 
* Data Sctrucutres
* Algorithms

Every programmer must at lewast be familair with the topics awe cover to be effective and able ot advance their understanding of programming.

## Number Systems(bases)

### What is base?

**Base** (or radix) is simply the number of digits that a number sytem has.

There are other number systems that have a different **base**.

**Decimal** (base 10) has 10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

The reason we know that 123 is 123 in decimal is from the above image, with the 10's multiplied by the number.

**Binary** (base 2) has 2 digits: 0, 1

![Alt text](imgs/binary_base_system.PNG)

We know the number similar to the decimal system because it is multiplied but by using 2's instead of 10's

**Hexadecimal** (base 16) has 10 digits and 6 letters: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 AND A, B, C, D, E, F

![Alt text](imgs/hexadecimal_base_system.PNG)

Same however it uses 16 because it is base 16. Starting from A count goes to 10 - 15 from A to F.

Converting hex to binary is quite easy because they map perfectly as seen in the image below.

### Converting from decimal to Binary

Generally the moethod from converting any base 10 (decimal) is to divide the number by the base. Keep dividing until the resulting quotient is a valid digit in the base (less tahn the base). The converted number starts with the final whole number and ends with the first remainder.

Meaning in below example last quotient is 1 therefore it starts with a 1 and the first remainder is 1 so it also ends in a 1. 

Another way of thinking about the order is that when doing the divisions is the first division is the first 2^0 and so on.

In this image remainer is 1 in 29/2 so thats the first one. THe next one is 14/2 which is remainder 0 and so on and so forth. This continues until 1 is lower than 2 so the conversion division is complete.

**Alternatively**

You are able to convert by checking the highest power that is able to fit in the the quotient and placing a 1 or 0 depending on the places and quotient. For example below using the number 25.

### Converting from decimal to Hexadecimal

Same order.

### Counting in other bases

![Alt text](imgs/Other_bases.PNG)

Counting in other bases is done by going up to the number and then going up to next 10's. 
* Base 13 uses ABC to do up to 13 base and then goes back to 10

### Adding Binary Numbers

Addition is the same however carrying numbers over is only done with 1's because 1 is the max number. Therefore a 2 carries the one over to the next line.

### Final Thoughts
* Always keep in mind what the number might be represeting
* Each digit in a number represents the value in that positiion times the power of the base for htt position
* TO convert from decimal to another base, we divide the decimal number y the base
* To convert from another base to decimal, we mulitply each place value by the power of the base for that position, then sum the results
* When we count in a base we can use only digits that are less than the base value
* When converting from 2 non decimal bases, use decimal as a middle meeting point to convert from one to another.

**What is a web framework?**
* Provides basic structure and functionality we need to build a web app
* Then add business logics as hooks into framework in order to customise framework to requirements
* A library imports library (module/pack) but the program has control the whole time. In  a framework has control when and where things happen, however we attach **hooks** to customize what happens when something occurs
  * Framework controls the control flow and we just make additions
  * Library we have control and then call when we need them
* Idea is to avoid having to write a lot of boilerplate code every time
*  Several to pick from
   *  Ruby - Rails, Sinatra
   *  C# - .NET
   *  Python - Django, Flask
   *  Javascript - Express, React


# Flask

It is a python web micro-framework meaning that it has everything needed for minimal functionality. To get full functionality plugins are needed, therefore can install only what is needed to get the job done

* Rails et al provide (almost) everythin needed out of the box
* Not a "kitchen sink" framework etc Rails, .NET or Django
  * MVC (Model-View-Coontroller) - Can be overkill for small projects
  * Projects are large (lots of files) and heavyweight (needs lots of server resources)
  * Opinionated - must use subsystems chosen by framework designers (e.g. use a specific ORM to access DB)

Flask is more similar to Sinatra and Express
* Provides basic routing, request/response and a dev server
* Agnostic - Use an DB, templating library, ORM, etc
  * Comes with Jinja templating but can swap in any template library
* Additional functionality can be added with packages
* Build a server from only the components needed
* Not MVC - Strucuture app however you want
* A more lightweight, performant solution
* Idea for building RESTful API's

## Running Flask

Setting up flask is simple, just use pip install while in a .venv so that it doesn't install globally.

`python3 -m venv .venv`

Then install simply using `pip install flask`

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"
```
1. Imported Flask
2. Created an instance of flask 
3. Used the `route()` decorator to tell flask what URL would trigger function
4. The function returns the message we want to display in the userâ€™s browser

To run the actual flask application
`flask --app hello run`

## Debug Mode

The debugger allows executing arbitrary Python code from the browser. It is protected by a pin, but still represents a major security risk. Do not run the development server or debugger in a production environment.

To use debug mode use debug while running the run code.

`flask --app hello run --debug`

## HTML Escaping

Flask has an inbuilt function `escape()` that is used for HTML escaping. It refers to the process of converting special characters such as `<`, `>`, `&`, and `"`, to their html counterparts. 

For example `"Hello"` is converted to `&quot;Hello&quot;`

## Routing

Modern web applications use meaningful URLs to help users.

Use the route() decorator to bind a function to a URL.


## SQLAlchemy

Alchemy allows the data put in a table puts it into a database table. Conversely it also moves the data in the database table into the table in Python object (the model).

**Analogy**

You request what you(python data model) want from a waiter(alchemy) the waiter translates this(to sql) bringing back to chef(posgres database result from request) and waiter (SQLAlchemy) translates it back and presents back to you (python data model)

**Setting up a table**



```python
class Card(db.Model): # inheriting from database SQLalchemy structure
    __tablename__ = 'cards' # declare name of table

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) # tells it is the primary key and it integer
    title = db.Column(db.String(100))
    description = db.Column(db.String())
    date_created = db.Column(db.Date())
```

Creates tables command
```python
@app.cli.command('create') # creates CLI customer commands, string can be anything
def create_db():
    db.create_all() # creates the databases that are defined above (as intepreted language)
    print('Tables created successfull')
```

By using `db.session` it ensures statements are all executed (all statements must succeed) if even one fails though the entire database gets rolled back to before the statements begun.

This sytem is called transaction system meaning its step by step.

`db.session.add()` adds like a git add
`db.session.commit()` commits the changes
